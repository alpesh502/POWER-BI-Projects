- Data-driven Decision Making: Lack of a centralized system to analyze and visualize sales trends effectively

## Process 
-Data Understanding & Requirement Gathering:-
Identify business challenges and key questions to answer.
Understand the sales data structure (transactions, customers, products, regions).

- Data Extraction (ETL - Extract, Transform, Load):-
Extract: Retrieve sales data from the MySQL database.
Transform: Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, correct data formats).
Load: Import the refined data into Power BI for visualization.

- Data Cleaning & Preparation in Power BI:-
Perform ETL operations in Power BI (Power Query Editor).
Remove duplicate records and inconsistencies.
Create new calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for deeper insights.
